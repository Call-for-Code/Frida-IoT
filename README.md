5. In the `Overview` dashboard, from the menu pane, select `Devices` and then click `Add Device`.
6. Select or create a device type for the device that you are adding.
In the device information page, copy and save the following device information:
- `Organization ID`, such as tubo8x
- `Device Type`, such as my_device_type
- `Device ID`, such as my_first_device
- `Authentication Method`, such as token
- `Authentication Token`, such as PtBVriRqIg4uh)_-Kl
